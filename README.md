# VrMovementAndUiPrototypes
Exploration of different types of user movement and UI/UX in VR through prototypes.

Testing Platform: GearVR

Interface Types:

1. "StandingStoneUI" - On swipe up standing stones appear with menu choices around the camera position. Double click selects a stone. Swipe down dismisses stones.

Movement Types:

1. "Third Person Point Targeting" - Select an external character and direct them to the position you are looking at with a double click.
2. "Motion Sickness Movement" - On double click starts self moving toward the position the rectile is pointing to. Causing the camera to move in such a way may cause motion sickness. A custom shader is applied to see if it alleviates/intensifies motion sickness.

New movement and interface types will be added periodically.
